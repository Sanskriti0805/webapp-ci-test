This interactive tool demonstrates how generative AI can auto-configure a pipeline based on project type, perform code analysis and security scans, diagnose build failures, recommend deployment strategies, and even automate rollbacks after a failed deployment. It showcases a smart, end-to-end software development lifecycle.",
